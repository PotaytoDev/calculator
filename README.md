# calculator
Project: Calculator - From The Odin Project curriculum.

This project will be an implementation of a basic calculator, being able to do
simple operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
HTML and CSS will be used to create the appearance of the calculator, including
the buttons and display for it, and JavaScript will be used for its behavior.

I recently learned more about objects and a few more array methods that are
very useful with handling data, so I will be putting them to use in this
project to gain more experience working with them.

This will be the final project of the Foundations Path in The Odin Project
curriculum, meaning that this project will use everything that has been taught
so far, along with things that I may have yet to learn in order to complete
the needed requirements.
